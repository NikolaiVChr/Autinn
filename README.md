## Retri Transistor Lowpass Filter

A 4-pole transistor ladder lowpass filter.

Knobs from top to bottom:

Temperature of the circuit. 10-60 degrees celcius.

Resonance CV and Resonance.

Cutoff CV and Cutoff frequency. 20-20KHz.

Voltage fine and coarse. Experiment with this to get the sound to your liking.

As you increase samplerate, you might have to increase block size also to make it not produce noise.

## Goals

Low CPU usage.

Nice and unique sound.

The graphics are placeholders for now. I am focusing on the sound.
